Goal : Implcit Hate detetction 

  1. Use HateBert and fine tuned it to detect : Implicit Hate, Explicit Hate , Not Hate
    - Tokenizer : HertBert tokenizer
    - Model : HateBert
    - Num Label : 3 ( Impl, Expl, No)

    
  3. Use HateBert and fine tuned it to detect various type of hate labelled in dataset
  4. Use Other Models and compare results
  5. Use other similar training data
